# Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step

**Notation**:
- Superscript $[l]$ denotes a quantity associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. 
    - Example: $a^{[L]}$ is the $L^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[L]}$ and $b^{[L]}$ are the $L^{th}$ layer parameters.
- Superscript $(i)$ denotes a quantity associated with the $i^{th}$ example. 
    - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example.
- Lowerscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.
    - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the $l^{th}$ layer's activations).

Let's get started!



## Outline

To build your neural network, you'll be implementing several "helper functions." These helper functions will be used in the next assignment to build a two-layer neural network and an L-layer neural network. 

Each small helper function will have detailed instructions to walk you through the necessary steps. Here's an outline of the steps in this assignment:

- Initialize the parameters for a two-layer network and for an $L$-layer neural network
- Implement the forward propagation module (shown in purple in the figure below)
     - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step (resulting in $Z^{[l]}$).
     - The ACTIVATION function is provided for you (relu/sigmoid)
     - Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] forward function.
     - Stack the [LINEAR->RELU] forward function L-1 time (for layers 1 through L-1) and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer $L$). This gives you a new L_model_forward function.
- Compute the loss
- Implement the backward propagation module (denoted in red in the figure below)
    - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's backward propagation step
    - The gradient of the ACTIVATE function is provided for you(relu_backward/sigmoid_backward) 
    - Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] backward function
    - Stack [LINEAR->RELU] backward L-1 times and add [LINEAR->SIGMOID] backward in a new L_model_backward function
- Finally, update the parameters



**Note**:

For every forward function, there is a corresponding backward function. This is why at every step of your forward module you will be storing some values in a cache. These cached values are useful for computing gradients. 

In the backpropagation module, you can then use the cache to calculate the gradients. Don't worry, this assignment will show you exactly how to carry out each of these steps!
